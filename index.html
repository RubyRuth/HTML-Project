          <span class="about">About the food:</span>Adalu can also be known as Beans and Corn Pottage.
          It is a delicious traditional meal that is indigenous to the Yoruba. They also call
          this food ewa ati agbado. The Igbos call this meal agwa na oka. This means that adalu 
          is a one pot meal of beans and corn.It is a great way to enjoy beans because it offers 
          you the best of two foods in a single meal. Black eyes beans is reputed to be the best 
          type of beans for preparing this food. The popular method of preparing Adalu is simply
        adding palmoil into cooked Beans and Corn but i prefer frying the blended pepper in palmoil
        then adding to boiled beans to complete the cooking process, though either way, It still
        turns out yummy.

                            Blend the bell peppers, tomato and scotch Bonnet to a smooth paste and 
                            set aside. Pick and wash your beans, get your corn ready and set aside.

                        <li>
                            Set a pot on a hob on high heat, pour in your washed beans.  
                            Add enough water to cover the beans and cook till half way done, this should take around
                            45 minutes. Do remember to check every now and then, also add more water when necessary.

                            Tip: To avoid cooking for too long, soak your beans overnight, this helps
                            to soften it prior to the cooking process and also helps to reduce flatulence…?
                            While the beans is cooking, set a small pot on a hob on medium heat. 
                            Add the palm oil, when it’s hot, add half of the chopped onions. Sauté till translucent…
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Now add the blended pepper, knorr cube and salt to taste…
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fry till oil floats to the top, when it does, switch the heat off and set aside.
                        </li>
                        Check on the beans, when it’s half done, add the remaining sliced onions, add the garlic and 
                        salt to taste, be careful not to add too much salt as the stew to be incorporated also contains salt.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Continue to cook till tender.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When it’s tender (you can mash half of the beans if you want at this time)
                            add the fried stew, then stir and combine.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Now add the corn, combine, leave to cook for 3 minutes…

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            And your Adalu is ready.

                        <li>
                            Serve immediately.

                        <li>
                            Adalu is best enjoyed on its own, served with fried plantain or mixed with Garri.
